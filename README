Overview of project topic:

For this project, we wanted to investigate graph coloring and decided to model 
/ prove a specific property. This property is that any undirected graph has a 
k-coloring if it has an acyclic orientation whose longest path has length less
than k.

Language we use:

We started implementing our model in Forge and then switched over to Alloy*
as we wanted to be able to do higher order quantification. More specifically 
we wanted to be able to enumerate over all acyclic orientations of an 
undirected graph and determine the minimum length of the longest path.

Setup / sigs that we use:

For our model, we wanted to be able to represented graphs where each node has a 
singular color. In order to do this, we have two main sigs: Node and Color. 

The Node sig has three sets within it: refs that defines all the edges in the 
undirected graph, acOri that defines the directed edges in the acyclic 
orientation of the graph which is optimal, dists that defines the distance
between a Node and all other Nodes in the acyclic orientation for a graph.
The Color sig has one set, nodeColors, that defines 
the color of each Node.

In order to have specific Nodes and Colors, we create additional sigs that 
extend our main two sigs. We have Node1-Node9 and Color1-Color9. We also made a 
pred oneOfEach that ensures that there is no more than one instance of each of 
the Node1-Node9 and Color1-Color9 sigs.

Parts of our model and how they fit together:

validReflexive – determines if a graph is a valid undirected graph
validDists – determines if the distances of the nodes in the graph are valid
validOrientation – determines if the acyclic orientation of a graph is valid
noAdjColors – ensures that no two adjacent nodes in a graph have the same color
oneColorPerNode – ensures that each node in a graph only has a single color
validColoring – determines if a graph coloring is valid
validKColoring – determines if a graph coloring is a valid k-coloring
kColorable – determines if it is possible to color a graph in k colors
isChromaticNumber – determines if a given number of colors is the smallest 
                    needed to color a graph
longestPath – this is a function that outputs the length of the longest path in 
              an acyclic orientation of a graph
minimalLongestLengthOrientation – determines if acyclic orientation's longest 
                                  path's length is the smallest of those of the 
                                  other acyclic orientations of a graph
setup – all of the predicates combined needed to verify the property.


Testing:

We have also created some preds that serve as instances for testing of our 
various preds mentioned above. These are listed below.

empty – the empty graph
single – single node graph
twoSymmetric – graph of two connected nodes
twoDisconnected – graph of two disconnected nodes
twoOneDirection – directed graph with two nodes
threeDistanceEdgeGraph – directed graph with three nodes and two edges
mostlySymmetricMany – directed graph with mostly symmetric edges
SymmetricMany – undirected graph (all symmetric edges)
mostlySymmetricManyWrongDists – directed graph with mostly symmetric edges and 
				some wrong distances
symmetricManyWrongDists – undirected graph (all symmetric edges) with some wrong distances
symmetricManyInvalidOrientationDup – undirected graph with invalid acyclic orientation
symmetricManyInvalidOrientationMissing – another undirected graph with invalid acyclic 						 orientation
manyMiscolored – graph with improper coloring
manyDuplicateNodeColor – graph where some nodes have more than one color
threeCompleteGraph – complete graph of three nodes
fourSimpleCycle – simple cycle graph with four nodes
fourCompleteGraph – complete graph with four nodes
minimumOrientation – graph whose acyclic orientation has the minimum longest length
symmetricNotMinimum – graph whose acyclic orientation does not have the minimum longest 		      length
symmetricManyMinimumOrientation – bigger graph whose acyclic orientation does not have the 				  minimum longest length
